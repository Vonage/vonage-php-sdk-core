# Getting Involved
 
Thanks for your interest in the project, we'd love to have you involved! Check out the sections below to find out more about what to do next...
 
## Opening an Issue
 
We always welcome issues, if you've seen something that isn't quite right or you have a suggestion for a new feature, please go ahead and open an issue in this project. Include as much information as you have, it really helps.
 
## Making a Code Change
 
We're always open to pull requests, but these should be small and clearly described so that we can understand what you're trying to do. Feel free to open an issue first and get some discussion going.
 
When you're ready to start coding, fork this repository to your own GitHub account and make your changes in a new branch. Once you're happy, open a pull request and explain what the change is and why you think we should include it in our project.
